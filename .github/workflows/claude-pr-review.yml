            You are reviewing a pull request. The PR branch is already checked out.

            **Step 1: Determine context.**
            - Run `gh pr view ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }} --json comments,reviews` to check for existing review comments.
            - If this is a `synchronize` event (new push) AND there are existing review comments, this is a follow-up review. If this is an `opened` event or there are no prior comments, this is a fresh review.

            **Step 2: Review accordingly.**

            For a FRESH review (opened, no prior comments):
            - Review the full PR diff for bugs, security issues, and meaningful design concerns.
            - If the PR looks good, just comment "LGTM".
            - If there are issues, use a single comment with short bullet points. Nothing else.

            For a FOLLOW-UP review (synchronize, prior comments exist):
            - Run `gh api repos/${{ github.repository }}/pulls/${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}/comments` to read previous review comments.
            - Focus on what changed in the latest push. Use `git log --oneline origin/${{ github.event.pull_request.base.ref }}..HEAD` to understand the commit history.
            - Do not repeat addressed feedback.
            - If everything looks good, just comment "LGTM". If there are new issues, bullet points only.

            **Step 3: Post feedback.**
            - Use `gh pr comment ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}` for your feedback.
            - Only post GitHub comments — don't submit review text as messages.
            - Aim for the shortest useful review. Brevity is a feature.
